In-Depth Networking Content
Networking is a foundational aspect of modern computing, enabling communication across devices, organizations, and the internet. Below is an extensive guide covering networking principles, protocols, security, and configurations.

1Ô∏è‚É£ Types of Networks
A. Based on Coverage Area
PAN (Personal Area Network) ‚Äì Short-range network (e.g., Bluetooth, Infrared).
LAN (Local Area Network) ‚Äì Connects devices in a small area like a home or office.
MAN (Metropolitan Area Network) ‚Äì Covers a city or large campus.
WAN (Wide Area Network) ‚Äì Spans large distances (e.g., the Internet).
B. Based on Network Design
Client-Server Network ‚Äì Clients request services from a centralized server.
Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Network ‚Äì All devices are equal; no centralized server.
Hybrid Network ‚Äì Combination of Client-Server and P2P models.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Network Topologies
Bus Topology ‚Äì Single communication line; failure can bring down the network.
Ring Topology ‚Äì Devices connected in a closed-loop; failure in one node can disrupt communication.
Star Topology ‚Äì Central switch/hub connects all devices; failure of a single device doesn't affect others.
Mesh Topology ‚Äì Every device connects to every other device; offers redundancy.
Hybrid Topology ‚Äì Combination of different topologies.
