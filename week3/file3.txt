Network Interface – Equivalent to OSI's Physical and Data Link layers.20: 
Internet Layer – Handles IP addressing and routing.21:

FTP (File Transfer Protocol) – Transfers files.26: 
SMTP/POP3/IMAP – Email protocols.27: 
DNS (Domain Name System) – Converts domain names to IP addresses.28: 
DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) – Assigns IP addresses dynamically.29: 
ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) – Maps IP addresses to MAC addresses.30: 
ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) – Used for error reporting (e.g., ping).31: 
4️⃣ IP Addressing32: 
IPv4 (e.g., 192.168.1.1) – 32-bit address.33: 
IPv6 (e.g., 2001:db8::1) – 128-bit address.34: 
Private IPs:35: 
Class A: 10.0.0.0 – 10.255.255.25536: 
Class B: 172.16.0.0 – 172.31.255.25537: 
Class C: 192.168.0.0 – 192.168.255.25538: 
Subnetting – Dividing networks into smaller subnetworks.39: 
5️⃣ Routing & Switching40: 
Routing: Determines the best path for data transmission.41: 
Static Routing – Manually configured.42: 
Dynamic Routing – Uses protocols like RIP, OSPF, BGP.43: 
Switching: Directs data between devices within a network.44: 
Layer 2 Switching (MAC-based).45: 
Layer 3 Switching (IP-based, VLANs).46: 
6️⃣ Network Security47: 
Firewalls – Blocks unauthorized access.48: 
VPN (Virtual Private Network) – Secure remote access.49: 
IDS/IPS (Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems) – Detects attacks.50: 
Encryption (SSL/TLS) – Secures data transmission.51:

In-Depth Networking Content61: 
Networking is a foundational aspect of modern computing, enabling communication across devices, organizations, and the internet. Below is an extensive guide covering networking principles, protocols, security, and configurations.62: 
63: 
1️⃣ Types of Networks64: 
A. Based on Coverage Area65: 
PAN (Personal Area Network) – Short-range network (e.g., Bluetooth, Infrared).66: 
LAN (Local Area Network) – Connects devices in a small area like a home or office.67: 
MAN (Metropolitan Area Network) – Covers a city or large campus.68: 
WAN (Wide Area Network) – Spans large distances (e.g., the Internet).69: 
B. Based on Network Design70: 
Client-Server Network – Clients request services from a centralized server.71: 
Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Network – All devices are equal; no centralized server.72: 
Hybrid Network – Combination of Client-Server and P2P models.73: 
2️⃣ Network Topologies74: 
Bus Topology – Single communication line; failure can bring down the network.75: 
Ring Topology – Devices connected in a closed-loop; failure in one node can disrupt communication.76: 
Star Topology – Central switch/hub connects all devices; failure of a single device doesn't affect others.77: 
Mesh Topology – Every device connects to every other device; offers redundancy.78: 
Hybrid Topology – Combination of different topologies.79: 
3️⃣ Network Models80: 
WPA3	AES, SAE	Latest, strongest encryption50: 
How to Secure Your Wi-Fi?51: 
✅ Use WPA3 or WPA2 encryption52: 
✅ Change the default SSID and password53: 
✅ Enable MAC address filtering54: 
✅ Disable WPS (Wi-Fi Protected Setup)55: 
✅ Regularly update the router firmware56: 
✅ Use a VPN for extra encryption57: 
58: 
6️⃣ Wi-Fi Performance Factors59: 
A. Factors Affecting Wi-Fi Speed:60: 
Distance from Router – The further you are, the weaker the signal.61: 
Interference – Other electronic devices can cause interference.62: 
Number of Devices Connected – Too many devices slow down Wi-Fi.63: 
Bandwidth & ISP Speed – Your internet speed depends on your ISP plan.64: 
Network Congestion – High traffic in a shared network reduces speed.65: 
B. How to Improve Wi-Fi Performance?66: 
✅ Place the router centrally in the house.67: 
✅ Reduce physical obstructions (walls, metal).68: 
✅ Use a Wi-Fi range extender for better coverage.69: 
✅ Upgrade to Wi-Fi 6 router for higher speeds.70: 
✅ Use wired Ethernet connections for gaming/streaming.71: 
72:
